    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An easy, no-yeast recipe for Dutch pancakes, which are called "poffertjes" in the Netherlands. They are traditionally made in a poffertjes pan which has indents, but you can use a large frying pan and scoop a small tablespoon of batter per poffertje into the pan. Serve the poffertjes warm with a knob of butter and powdered sugar.
